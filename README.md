## UPDATE
This web app is no longer live and has been migrated to a static website here: https://github.com/georgebjork/LeviathanRipBlog-Static

While the web app was fun to have, I didnt want to pay the 5 dollars a month to host it anymore. ðŸ™‚

This repository has been archived as a result. 

## Purpose

LeviathanRipBlog is a centralized platform designed for my friends and me to chronicle and revisit our Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) sessions. This application serves as a digital archive where game sessions can be stored, reread, and managed.

## Architecture

LeviathanRipBlog is built on a robust and modern technology stack, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience:

- **Framework:** ASP.NET MVC on .NET 8.
- **Front-end:** Bootstrap 5.3, Font Awesome icons, and HTMX to add interactivity.
- **Hosting:** The web server is hosted on Digital Ocean using their App Platform Service.
- **Database:** Supabase free tier.
- **Storage:** Supabase free tier.
- **CI/CD:** The main branch is configured to automatically deploy new Docker images to Digital Ocean and deploy the newest image automatically.


## Todo List 
- Add campaign characters with descriptions and images
- Timeline
- Add username first name, and last name so email isn't displayed
